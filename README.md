# ResearchOS
This modern SciML platform is designed for practitioners eager to make the leap from supervised ML toward operator learning, inverse problems, hybrid differentiable solvers, and manifold/geometry tasks. This project is deliberately simplified; and extensible to neural operators, multi-domain PDE solvers, and multiphysics.
